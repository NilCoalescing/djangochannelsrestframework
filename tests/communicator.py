class Communicator(WebsocketCommunicator):
    """
    Custom communicator class for WebSocket communication in tests.

    This override resolves an issue where the default ApplicationCommunicator
    cancels the application future unnecessarily when a timeout occurs
    while waiting for output. This behavior disrupts subsequent attempts
    to receive output or reconnect, causing the application to raise
    CancelledError.

    The `receive_output` method is modified to:
    - Avoid cancelling the application future when a timeout occurs.
    - Ensure that the method can be called repeatedly without causing
      failures in subsequent operations.

    This makes the communicator more flexible for tests where output
    availability is uncertain, allowing patterns like:

        outputs = []
        while True:
            try:
                outputs.append(await communicator.receive_output())
            except asyncio.TimeoutError:
                break

    Asynchronous context manager for managing WebSocket communicator lifecycle.

    This utility simplifies tests involving WebSocket communication by:
    - Initializing and connecting a Communicator instance for the given consumer and path.
    - Ensuring the connection is properly established, raising an assertion error if not.
    - Guaranteeing cleanup by disconnecting the communicator upon exiting the context.

    Example usage:

        async with connected_communicator(TestConsumer) as communicator:
            await communicator.send_json_to({"key": "value"})
            response = await communicator.receive_json_from()
